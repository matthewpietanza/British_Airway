I found this data set online and then ported it to Tableau. From there I wanted to create an interactive dashboard for the user to be able to customize and break down the data, so I created 6 metrics that allowed the user to manipulate: Overall Rating, Cabin Staff Service, Entertainment, Food, Ground Serivce, and Comfort. Then to break the information down even further on the dashboard I allow for the user to manipulate the timeframe, type of traveler, seat type, aircraft, and continent. The graphs will then automatically populate everytime the user changes any of the values available. The dashboard features a line graph displaying the metric over time by month, geological map, and a double bar graph by aircraft
